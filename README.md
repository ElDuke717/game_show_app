# game_show_app
This is a game show app similar to Wheel of Fortune.  It's the fourth project in the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. 

This project is being submitted for "Exceeds Expectations", with the following added meet the rubrick:

* Personalization - A number of things have been added to make the project unique - the start screen overlay has had some changes to the text.  Also, the "live" icons on the bottom have been replaced with my own pngs of red hearts and poop emojis.  The overlays for win and lose gamestates have been changed as well, the text of the reset button is different for each. Lastly, each gamestate overlay has custom pngs added to it to make the game more fun.  Additional phrases have been added to make the game more interesting, too. 

* Keyboard listener - a keyboard listener has been implemented so that the player can use their physical keyboard along with the on screen qwerty version.  The functionality is otherwise the same.
